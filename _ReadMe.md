#ElipseJava to Prolog

This code was built using Eclipse IDE for java. ALso uses ECLiPSe (Constraint Programmin System) which is a prolog engine.

Can use java code with any java ide, but the prolog portion should be from ECLiPSe, since java code relies on calling functions from the ECLiPSe library. Can download all of ECLiPSe from http://www.eclipseclp.org/index.html . Download comes with TKECLiPSe which is a GUI for the ECLiPSe engine. 

Linking ECLiPSe engine to Java details in EclipseToJava/src/prologCall.java

grade.pl is the basic prolog code associated with Java code
